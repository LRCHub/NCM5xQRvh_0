# MAN WITH A MISSION – MAN WITH A MISSION 『86 Missed Calls feat. Patrick Stump』

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
I sweep these floors
clean the mess like a fighter
Try to keep away
from what you wanted from me
I keep climbing higher
like my feet are on fire
And all your little words
are like gasoline
Every step I take the road
just breaks apart behind
Miss another train and
I wave to the riders
I won’t let you threaten me
out of my dream
We were too drunk punching holes
through the ceiling
Living hard
cause dying’s too easy
Followed by your ghost
86 missed calls from home
86 missed calls from home
I’ve got my vision and
I’m on a mission
The only way I’m ever given up
Is when the world stops
spinning Believe me
People deny me I don’t know why
it doesn’t matter
I won’t let you threaten me
out of my dream
We were too drunk punching holes
through the ceiling
Living hard
cause dying’s too easy
Followed by your ghost
86 missed calls from home
86 missed calls from home
86 missed calls from home
And I checked my phone
86 missed calls from home
And I checked my phone
86 missed calls from home
we are too drunk punching holes
through the ceiling
Livin hard
cause dying’s too easy
Followed by your ghost
86 missed calls from
86 missed calls from home
86 missed calls from home
