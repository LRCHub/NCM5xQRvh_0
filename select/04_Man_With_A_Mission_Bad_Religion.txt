Rescue me when I get too deep,
Talk to me there's nothing to tell,
Everyone, is a hypocrite,
Look to me,
I'll save your soul
Now somebody out there must be
Reading my mail
'cause' everybody knows
I'm a man with a mission,
Coming to your town today,
I can damn you to fiery perdition,
'cause' I'm a man with a mission
Follow me, when you give up,
Work for me, it'll serve you well
Everyone is a hypocrite, come to me,
I'll save your soul
Now somebody out there must be
Tapping my phone,
'cause everybody knows
I'm a man with a mission,
I'm gonna fly you away,
High above the noise and competition,
Yeah I'm a man with a mission,
Passing through your town today
I condemn you
To fiery perdition,
Yeah I'm a man with a mission
