The mysteries, the miracles
The magic, unpredictable
There's something that we know
It's always in our souls as we roam

The future and the past
And nothing ever lasts
'Cause today's the day we share
To praise and to declare as we roam

Some days we win, some days we lose
Another day, another blues
Know what you're worth, your way to go
One day you'll find one thing to hold
Shout it out to the world!

The glory in our hands
The anthem ringing through the lands
There's nothing in our way
Not a thing to be afraid as we roam

Though defeated, though we fail
We will rise again. Yeah, we will prevail
'Cause today's the day we sing

To join and spread our wings. Let us roam
Some days we win, some days we lose
Another day, another blues
Know what you're worth, your way to go
One day you'll find one thing to hold

Shout it out to the...
Some days we cry, some days we laugh
One day we'll find, find out our path
Let us believe, let us behold

One day you'll find one thing to hold
Shout it out to the world!
Some days we win, some days we lose
Another day, another blues
Know what you're worth, your way to go
One day you'll find one thing to hold
Shout it out to the...
Some days we cry, some days we laugh
One day we'll find, find out our path
Let us believe, let us behold
One day you'll find one thing to hold
Shout it out to the world!
