Ol' Johnny's got a heart of gold
Ask anyone around here
But some nights his eyes are far away
And filled with tears
Sweet Mary Lou's just as good as they come
With a weakness for all the wrong men
From the look on her face tonight, she's been wrong again
Bartender's thinkin' to himself as he rubs his towel around a glass
Now there's a man with a memory
There's a woman with a past
Lost souls on life's highway
Forever lookin' back
When you're livin' for the love
And the love doesn't last
You get a man with a memory
A woman with a past
Bartender turns the TV down
Cranks that ol' jukebox up
Carefully selects which buttons to push
For what each song does
C-23 after J-19, it's a tonic for a broken heart
A little Stardust in the mix, it's a fine, fine art
Dim the lights a notch or two
The next round is on the house
For the man with a memory
And the woman with a past
Lost souls on life's highway
Forever lookin' back
When you're livin' for the love
And the love doesn't last
You get a man with a memory
A woman with a past
Oh, we've all got somethin'
We've got to get around
Now and then you get the chance
To help the lost get found
Stackin' chairs and sweepin' up
He can't help a little smile
Thinkin' 'bout the man with a memory
And the woman with a past
Lost souls on life's highway
Forever lookin' back
When you're livin' for the love
And the love doesn't last
You get a man with a memory
A woman with a past
You get a man with a memory
A woman with a past
