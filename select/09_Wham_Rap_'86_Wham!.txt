You don't take no shit from a benefit

Hey, everybody, take a look at me
I've got street credibility
I may not have a job, but I have a good time
With the boys that I meet down on the line
I don't need you
So you don't approve
Well, who asked you to?
Hey, jerk, you work
This boy's got better things to do
I ain't never gonna work, get down in the dirt
I choose to cruise
Gonna live my life sharp as a knife
I've found the groove and I just can't lose
A1 style from head to toe
Cool cat flash gonna let you know
I'm a soul boy, I'm a dole boy
Take pleasure in leisure, I believe in joy

Wham, bam
I am a man
Job or no job
You can't tell me that I'm not
Do, you
Enjoy what you do?
If not, just stop
Don't stay there and rot

Party nights and neon lights
We hit the floors, we hit the heights
Dancing shoes and pretty girls
Boys in leather kiss girls in pearls
Hot damn, everybody, let's play
So they promised you a good job, no way
One, two, three, rap
C'mon everybody, don't need this crap

Wham, bam
I am a man
Job or no job
You can't tell me that I'm not
Do, you
Enjoy what you do?
If not, just stop
Don't stay there and rot

Cool cat, cool cat, cool-cool cat
Cool cat, cool cat
Cool cat, cool cat, cool-cool cat
(Enjoy what you do)

If you're a pub man
Or a club man
Maybe a jet black guy with a hip hi-fi
A white cool cat with a trilby hat
Maybe leather and studs is where you're at
Make the most of every day
Don't let hard times stand in your way
Give a wham, give a bam, but don't give a damn
Cause the benefit gang are gonna pay

Now reach up high and touch your soul
The boys from Wham! will help you reach that goal
It's gonna break your mama's heart (so sad)
It's gonna break your daddy's heart (too bad)
But you'll throw the dice take my advice
'Cos I know that you're smart
Can you ding this thing? (YEAH!)
Are you gonna get down? (YEAH!)
Say Wham! (WHAM)
Say bam! (BAM)
