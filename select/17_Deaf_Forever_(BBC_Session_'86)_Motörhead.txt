Stone face dog, swirling fog, gates open on the dark, dark night
Standing stone, skull and bone, dead witness to an unseen fight
Beat the drum, beat the drum, beat forever on the endless march
Stricken dumb, cut and run, somebody's screaming and the sky is dark

Sword and shield, bone and steel, rictus grin
Deaf forever to the battles din
Deaf forever to the battles din

March or croak, flame and smoke, burn forever in eternal pain
Charge and fall, bugle call, bone splinter in the driving rain
Horses scream, Viking dream, drowned heroes in a lake of blood
Armored fist, severed wrist, broken spears in a sea of mud

Sword and shield, bone and steel, rictus grin
Deaf forever to the battles din
Deaf forever to the battles din

Deaf forever
Stone deaf forever

Mother earth, mother earth, enfold you in her cold embrace
Sinking down, killing ground, worm crawling on your cold white face
Win or lose, naught to choose, all men are equal when their memory fades
No one knows, friends or foes, if Valhalla lies beyond the grave

Sword and shield, bone and steel, rictus grin
Deaf forever to the battles din
Deaf forever to the battles din
Deaf forever to the battles din
Deaf forever to the battles din, hey
