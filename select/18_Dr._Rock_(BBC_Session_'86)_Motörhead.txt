Alright, alright
I hope your son of bitches see the light
You again, you again
I know you've got a mental age of ten

Listen up, listen up
I wouldn't swap you for a thousand bucks
Come on, you're the one
I think I'm gonna switch your lazer on

I've got the medicine you need
I've got the power, got the speed
I'll find out how to stop your clock
We sure ain't talking, Doctor Spock
Hear me talking, Doctor Rock

Lie down, turn around
Here comes the sister, gonna strip you down
Shut up, breathe in
Let's have the address of your next of kin

Chin up, shoulders back
You've got a body like a Marshall Sack
Keep still, take your pill
I'm gonna make you really ill

I've got the medicine you need
I've got the power, I've got the speed
I'll find out how to stop your clock
We sure ain't talking, Doctor Spock
Hear me talking, Doctor Rock

Next please, next please
Try to separate those cowardly knees
X-ray, you've gotta pay
The only chance you've ever got to get away

Here we are, what's the scar?
I don't like anything I've seen so far
Pay me, pay me
I ain't no doctor of philosophy

I've got the medicine you need
I've got the power, I've got the speed
I'll find out how to stop your clock
We sure ain't talking, Doctor Spock
Hear me talking, Doctor Rock
