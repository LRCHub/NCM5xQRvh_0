I have chosen you my friend, you're mine
Locked inside this frightening dream
Nowhere to hide
Every night my demons you will see
An apparition festival, through hell you'll ride

Phantasmagoria
Sleep well
Phantasmagoria
In hell

Some one here is calling out your name
Look out, I play inside your brain
Fleeing from my shadows, you'll never pass my test
Don't you know that ghosts never rest

Phantasmagoria
Sleep well
Phantasmagoria
In hell

Approaching, you writhe, we take control
Unholy inquisition, sentence very cold
My servants, demon, take you down the hole
Your mind destroyed, now I want your soul

Phantasmagoria
Sleep well
Phantasmagoria
In hell

Phantasmagoria
Phantasmagoria
In hell
