It's a madman's situation, reminiscing in the rain
And I lost your love again, I call your name
And I don't want to think about it, when I go to sleep at night
Can you hear it in the wind? I call your name

I call your name, I call your name
I call your name, I call your name

And I close the door behind me and I turn the lights all down
There's no one there beside me, I call your name
And I don't want to think about it, but I wind up all the same
Nothing'll ever change, I call your name

I call your name, I call your name
I call your name, I call your name

Lie awake under the stars, lie awake under the stars
I call your name, I call your name
Lie awake under the stars, lie awake under the stars

I call your name, I call, I call your name
I call your name, I call your name
I call your name, I call your name
Call your name, call your name, I call your name
